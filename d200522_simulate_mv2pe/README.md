# Simulating mv2pe
The purpose of these is to investigate the Charge and Intensity Resolution in order to select the mv2pe we need to be aiming for in the final SST camera design, and to check that the requirements (Intensity Resolution) can be met by our proposed camera, taking into account electronic noise, ENF, NSB, dynamic range, saturation, and PDE.
